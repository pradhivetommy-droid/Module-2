# ðŸ”º Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate **Pascalâ€™s Triangle**, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows from the user.
3. Loop from 0 to the number of rows.
4. For each row:
   - Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.
   - Compute values using the formula:  
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
5. Print all rows of Pascalâ€™s Triangle.
6. End the program.

---

## ðŸ§ª Program
```
from math import factorial

rows = int(input(""))

for i in range(rows):
    print(" " * (rows - i - 1), end="")

    for j in range(i + 1):
        val = factorial(i) // (factorial(j) * factorial(i - j))
        print(val, end=" ")
    
    print() 

```

## Result
A Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user was completed successfully and output was generated.
